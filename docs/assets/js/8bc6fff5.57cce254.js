Instead of showing what kind of machine you're getting, they charge based on abstract performance tiers, like handling a fixed number of requests per second. This approach also obscures pricing, since the flat rate often exceeds the actual cost of the underlying hardware. In contrast, Rabbitory\u2019s cost is always transparent, as it reflects AWS\u2019s EC2 and DynamoDB pricing models. Additionally, when creating a RabbitMQ instance, users choose exactly what EC2 instance type and storage size fit their use case. We provide helpful hardware recommendations based on throughput and expected message size, but users remain in control of their hardware."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Another major benefit of self-hosting Rabbitory is that users own their infrastructure and data. With CloudAMQP, you don\u2019t own the infrastructure you use. Instead, you pay CloudAMQP a flat rate to manage RabbitMQ for you on infrastructure that they provision and control. You can pick a region and hardware plan, but you don\u2019t have root access to the server, full environment control, or ownership of the underlying cloud resources. Similarly, with AmazonMQ \u2014a larger competitor \u2014 you can choose regions, instance types, and virtual private networks, but you do not get direct access to the EC2 instances. Rather, it\u2019s as if you are renting a RabbitMQ EC2 instance within a sandbox that AWS controls."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Rabbitory, by contrast, allows developers to run RabbitMQ on EC2 instances they own, provisioned within their AWS account.
