## Future Work

While Rabbitory is already a robust solution, there is always room for growth. Below are some of the features and enhancements we plan to explore in future updates:

- Control Panel Login Page
- Support for more protocols: AMQPS, MQTTS, STOMPS, and STREAM_SSL
- RabbitMQ Clustering Support
- Support for additional Cloud Platforms
- Optional Automatic Metrics Setup
- Instance Benchmarking
- Showing cost/month on the frontend

## Final Thoughts

Rabbitory offers a fresh approach to managed RabbitMQ. It gives developers the convenience of a Control Panel and CLI, along with the transparency and control of owning their infrastructure. It's a cost-effective, self-hosted alternative that puts flexibility and control at the center of the platform.

In the broader managed message broker ecosystem, Rabbitory fills a critical niche. It's ideal for teams that want the power of RabbitMQ without the limitations of opaque and overpriced managed services. With Rabbitory, you get an open-source, self-hosted RabbitMQ management tool that fits your asynchronous communication needs.
