In our example, our e-commerce site wants to send a letter to a third-party payment processor. Our e-commerce site places this \u201cletter\u201d, a request to process a payment, into a message queue for safekeeping. When the payment processor is available, it checks the \u201cmailbox\u201d for any pending payment requests. In this way, the sender (our e-commerce site) no longer needs to wait or worry about when or whether the message is received. The sender of a message is often called the producer, and the receiver is called the consumer. In essence, a message queue allows software systems to decouple the actions of the producer from those of the consumer.
